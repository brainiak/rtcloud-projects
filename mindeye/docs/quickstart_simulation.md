# Quickstart for Simulated Real-Time MindEye
Set up and run real-time image reconstruction using MindEye using RT-Cloud to stream pre-collected data.

## Introduction
This quickstart guide will walk you through the minimal setup to start producing real-time reconstructions using MindEye with data streaming using RT-Cloud.  

This requires familiarity with Python, git, and the command line. Specific code snippets that you should run will be formatted like `this text`. Within code snippets, paths that might differ on your computer will be formatted like `<this>`.

This assumes you have completed the setup instructions in the [README](../README.md) and are able to run MindEye in standalone form (without RT-Cloud).
